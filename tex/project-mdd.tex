	%\begin{Exercise}[title={Implementing the Solver}]
	%\\
	%The first task of this assignment is for you to implement the vanilla
	%algorithm as it has been explained during the lecture (see slide 67). To help you, we
	%provide you with a well-documented framework that defines and implements
	%all the abstractions you will need to implement a generic solver.
	%Additionally, and because the BaB-MDD framework parallelizes \emph{VERY}
	%well, we provide you with a parallel implementation of the algorithm
	%(ParallelSolver). Digging into that code, understanding it, and
	%stripping away all the parallel-related concerns should finalize to give
	%you a thorough understanding of the sequential algorithm.
	%Before diving into the code, answer the following few questions to make sure you get
	%a good grasp of the basics behind BaB-MDD algorithm.

	\begin{Exercise}[title={Application to Knapsack}]\\
		Consider the following figure: it depicts an exact DD encoding all solutions to a knapsack problem instance (it uses the same model as in the slides). In this instance, the sack has a capacity of $70$, and the costs-and-profits of each item are given as follows:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{| l | r | r | r | r | }
				\hline
				&$x_0$ &$x_1$&$x_2$ &$x_3$ \\

	\begin{Exercise}[title={Building Nuclear Plants}]
		\\
		To decarbonate the European economy, Mrs. From-the-Streets, minister of energy,
		has decided to refresh electric infrastructure and build new nuclear plants all over the
		continent. This, however, has to be done in a principled way and no two power plants can
		be located too close to one another as there is a risk it would cause excess tension.
		Given a map of the infrastructure with candidateOld build sites, you are asked to find
		the set of locations where to construct power plants without violating safety constraints.

		In practice, the map will be given to you in the form of a sizeable \emph{undirected} graph.
		In that graph, each node represents a candidateOld build site, and two sites are connected
		with an edge if they are too close to one another (or more generally, if building a power
		plant at both sites causes a potential safety hazard). The problem which you are asked to
		solve is thus the following: you must find a maximum subset of the nodes in the graph
		such that no two construction sites are connected with an edge in the underlying graph.

		\subsection*{Example:}
		The below graph depicts a situation where 6 candidateOld construction sites have been identified.
		It also shows that it would not be safe to build a nuclear plant at site 1 and 2 at the same
		time, or to build some at both sites 3 and 5. In this example, a solution that maximizes the
		energy production while guaranteeing safety constraints is the set $\left\{ 1, 4, 5, 6 \right\}$.

	\begin{Exercise}[title={Experimental comparison of widths}]

		We are interested to compare experimentally the time required by the MDD solver to solve the instances, width different widths provided for the MDD.
		We can perform time measurement on benchmark instances and report them graphically.
		Given the 20 instances \texttt{decarbonation\_100\_XXX.dimacs} within the \texttt{data/decarbonation/instances} directory, analyze the running time of the solver with the widths:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 1
			\item 50
			\item 100
			\item 1000
			\item 2000
			\item 5000
			\item 10 000
		\end{itemize}
		You need to use the \textbf{sequential implementation of your solver} when running the experiments.


		\Question Give the cactus plot of the running time to solve the 20 instances for each of the 7 widths provided. Your \textit{x} axis should be the maximum time allowed (possibly in log scale, it's up to you to choose) and the \textit{y} axis the cumulated number of problems solved within the maximum time (i.e. your curves for each width need to reach y=20 when all instances are solved, and the y value for each curve is incremented each time a new instance has been solved). You can find one example of such a plot \href{https://jeremiasberg.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/cactus_plot_side_v4.jpg?w=346&h=205}{here}.
